# Gorur Tengri

A survival horror game built with Rust and Bevy. Heavily inspired by Mongolian and Turkic folklore. Title is partly Tatar and roughly translates to "Prideful God". Full disclosure, I don't speak Tatar so I got that title by typing stuff into Google Translate. I have quite literally no idea if that's grammatically correct.

Not putting a license on this so I can retain full copyright while I figure out what, if any business model I would distribute it under. I'm mostly just doing this to have a rust project that I can put on my resume.
